# Introduction
Cheun Chugs & Cheers (henceforth referred to by its ticker symbol CCAC, or simply “the client”) is an American hospitality company. Founded in 2008 in Reno, NV, by eponymous owner Jacquelyn Cheun, CCAC owns and operates a number of popular bars along the East Coast, including:

Reproducible Refreshment with OurStudio
Statistics Never Lie
Below the Tableau
Spam and Eggs
Munging by Moonlight
CCAC prefers sourcing the majority of its food and liquor from partners in the same states as its bars to give guests a taste of local flavor and home state pride, a decision that continues to receive widespread acclaim from consumers. Surveys repeatedly cite the wide selection of different, high-quality local beers as the number one feature that keeps drawing regulars and newcomers alike through the doors.

In December 2018, CCAC announced its interest in opening a new bar somewhere in the United States. The new establishment’s working name is The Meta Scientist. Its design concept is a casual hangout targeted at college students (of legal drinking age) and young professionals; the millennial generation, known for intentionally seeking novel experiences like new beers, constitutes a large segment of CCAC’s existing clientele. All current brewery partners, along with a number of new potential partners located across the country, submitted the names of beers they would be interested in providing on opening day.


# Problem Statement
To assist with its decision in choosing a state to host The Meta Scientist, CCAC has enlisted the aid of SMBrew Consulting (the authors of this document), a firm specializing in the hospitality industry. The client has provided us with two data sets:

Breweries.csv: A table of 558 US breweries that have indicated interest in providing beer for The Meta Scientist.
Beers.csv: A table of the 2,410 US craft beers those breweries make.
Additionally, CCAC has outlined several questions of interest about the data in its initial consultation document. For ease of use to our client, those questions are explicitly numbered and answered below.

# Conclusion
In summary, the following statements apply for the original Breweries.csv and Beers.csv data sets:

Some beers lack values for ABV, IBU, and/or Style.
ABV and IBU have a moderate positive correlation. As one increases, the other also tends to increase.
By state, ABV has a median range of [0.040, 0.0625]. IBU has a median range of [19, 61].
The state with the highest ABV is Colorado. The highest IBU belongs to Oregon. The lowest of both comes from California.

# Recommendation
Our recommendation is one of these states.  Download the source and knit to see our reasoning
