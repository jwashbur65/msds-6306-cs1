Cheun Chugs & Cheers (henceforth referred to by its ticker symbol CCAC, or simply "the client") is an American hospitality company. Founded in 2008 in Reno, NV, by eponymous owner Jacquelyn Cheun, CCAC owns and operates a number of popular bars along the East Coast, including:

* Reproducible Refreshment with OurStudio
* Statistics Never Lie
* Below the Tableau
* Spam and Eggs
* Munging by Moonlight

CCAC prefers sourcing the majority of its food and liquor from partners in the same states as its bars to give guests a taste of local flavor and home state pride, a decision that continues to receive widespread acclaim from consumers. Surveys repeatedly cite the wide selection of different, high-quality local beers as the number one feature that keeps drawing regulars and newcomers alike through the doors. 

In December 2018, CCAC announced its interest in opening a new bar somewhere in the United States. The new establishment's working name is The Meta Scientist. Its design concept is a casual hangout targeted at college students (of legal drinking age) and young professionals; the millennial generation, known for intentionally seeking novel experiences like new beers, constitutes a large segment of CCAC's existing clientele. All current brewery partners, along with a number of new potential partners located across the country, submitted the names of beers they would be interested in providing on opening day.

```{r logo2, out.width="150px", fig.align="center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/SMBrew.png")
```

To assist with its decision in choosing a state to host The Meta Scientist, CCAC has enlisted the aid of SMBrew Consulting (the authors of this document), a firm specializing in the hospitality industry. The client has provided us with two data sets:

* Breweries.csv: A table of 558 US breweries that have indicated interest in providing beer for The Meta Scientist.
* Beers.csv: A table of the 2,410 US craft beers those breweries make.

Additionally, CCAC has outlined several questions of interest about the data in its initial consultation document. For ease of use to our client, those questions are explicitly numbered and answered below.

# Data Input & Cleansing

First, the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv files are loaded into our analysis language and environment of choice, R and RStudio, as data frames. Aside from some instances of missing attributes, the data already looks tidy. Certain variables in each data frame are renamed in preparation for merging at a future step.

``` {r loading_and_cleaning}

# Initialize by loading data sets.
beers_raw <- read.csv("./Analysis/Beers.csv", 
                      header=TRUE, 
                      sep=",", 
                      na.strings=c("","NA"))
breweries_raw <- read.csv("./Analysis/Breweries.csv", 
                          header=TRUE, 
                          sep=",", 
                          na.strings=c("","NA"))

# Create working copies. Remove white space from State column.
beers_clean <- data.frame(beers_raw)
breweries_clean <- data.frame(breweries_raw)
breweries_clean$State <- as.factor(trimws(breweries_clean$State))

# Change column name of brewery ID to match for merging. Differentiate "Name" columns.
names(beers_clean)[names(beers_clean) == "Brewery_id"] <- "Brewery_ID"
names(beers_clean)[names(beers_clean) == "Name"] <- "Beer_Name"
names(breweries_clean)[names(breweries_clean) == "Brew_ID"] <- "Brewery_ID"
names(breweries_clean)[names(breweries_clean) == "Name"] <- "Brewery_Name"

# Change data types of Names to character. Style, City, and State remain factors.
beers_clean$Beer_Name <- as.character(beers_clean$Beer_Name)
breweries_clean$Brewery_Name <- as.character(breweries_clean$Brewery_Name)

```

# Questions of Interest:
## 1. How many breweries are present in each state? 

The number of breweries present in each state can be ascertained directly from the data frame of Breweries.csv. (For simplicity, Washington D.C. is referred to as a state, bringing the total number of states to 51.) Each occurrence of the state's abbreviation under the State column is interpreted as the corresponding brewery being located in the state. Therefore, we can count how many times the abbreviation appears to obtain the number of breweries in that state.

``` {r number_of_breweries_1}

# Count instances of state using count() from plyr.
breweries_count_state <- count(breweries_clean, "State")
names(breweries_count_state)[names(breweries_count_state) == "freq"] <- c("Num_Breweries")

# Choropleth map using usmap library, which returns ggplot objects. First clean state column to meet plot_usmap() argument requirements.
breweries_count_state$State <- as.character(breweries_count_state$State)
names(breweries_count_state)[names(breweries_count_state) == "State"] <- c("state")

# Then, create choropleth map.
bcs_choro <- plot_usmap(data = breweries_count_state, 
                        values = "Num_Breweries", 
                        lines = "brown") +
  ggtitle("Breweries Per State") +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Number of Breweries",
                        low = "white", 
                        high = "orange") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
bcs_choro

```

The above choropleth map provides a visual look at the number of breweries present in each state. Darker color indicates more breweries. Note that the flat number of breweries is used for the entire state; it is not adjusted by density or in terms of landmass, population, or location within the state.

```{r number_of_breweries_2, echo=F, results="hide"}

# Bar graph for all 50 states plus DC. Table output and choropleth map favored. An early placeholder visualization hidden in the final html document. Code saved to reuse for other bar graphs.
bcs_bars <- breweries_count_state %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, Num_Breweries), y = Num_Breweries)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Number of Breweries Per State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Number of Breweries") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

```

``` {r number_of_breweries_3}

# Kable output for breweries in each state.
breweries_count_state <- breweries_count_state %>% arrange(desc(Num_Breweries))
kable(breweries_count_state,
      col.names = c("State",
                    "Number of Breweries"),
      row.names = T,
      caption="Number of breweries in each state:",
      table.attr="style='width:30%;'") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

This table provides the exact numbers for all 51 states. The following details are notable:

* Colorado has the most breweries, 47. It is the only state in this data set containing more than 40 breweries.
* California (39), Michigan (32), Oregon (29), Texas (28), Pennsylvania (25), Massachusetts (23), Washington state (23), Indiana (22), and Wisconsin (20) round out the rest of the top ten.
* Each state has at least one brewery in the data set.
* North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington DC, and Wyoming are tied for the least breweries, with one apiece.

## 2. Merge beer data with breweries data. 

The breweries and beers in these data sets have a one-to-many relationship; each brewery can produce multiple beers, but each beer is only linked to a single brewery. Both data sets share brewery ID as a common variable, so it can be used to merge the breweries data set into the beers data set for further analysis.

```{r merge}

# Merge data sets using shared Brewery_ID column.
merged_beers_clean <- merge(beers_clean, breweries_clean, by = c("Brewery_ID", "Brewery_ID"), all = TRUE)

# Reorder columns: all beer-related variables, then all brewery-related variables.
merged_beers_clean <- merged_beers_clean[c("Beer_Name", "Beer_ID", "ABV", 
                               "IBU", "Style", "Ounces",
                               "Brewery_Name", "Brewery_ID", "City", "State")]

# Check merged file by printing first and last six observations.
kable(head(merged_beers_clean, 6), 
      caption="First 6 Rows of Merged Data",
      row.names = T) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
kable(tail(merged_beers_clean, 6), 
      caption="Last 6 Rows of Merged Data",
      row.names = T) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

The first and last six observations of the merged data frame are printed to show that the merge was successful. Note that because the brewery ID was used as the merging column, the new data frame is sorted in ascending order by that variable. Brewery_ID = 1 appears for the first six rows, while Brewery_ID = 558 appears in the final row of the last six, 558 being the number of breweries in the original Breweries.csv file. Furthermore, the row numbers for the last six observations indicate that all 2,410 craft beers from the original Beers.csv file made it into this merged data frame.

## 3. Report number of NAs in each column.

The above table of the last six observations displays "NA," or not available, for the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) variable, indicating that those beers are missing IBU values. Knowing whether or not a variable is missing values is important because unless the NAs are explicitly ignored, some functions in R will return NA as an answer if NA occurs even once.

```{r num_nas}

# Report the number of NAs in each column.
num_nas <- colSums(is.na(merged_beers_clean))
kable(num_nas, 
      col.names = c("Number of NAs"),
      caption="Number of NAs Per Column",
      table.attr="style='width:30%;'") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

Any instances of NA are counted and reported in this table, which shows that the Alcohol By Volume (ABV) and IBU columns contain NAs, with 62 and 1,005, respectively. Additionally, 5 blanks in the Style column are also considered NAs. None of the other columns have missing values.



## 4. Compute median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. 

The median is calculated by using the aggregate function to apply the median command function to each of the ABV values listed by State.   The NA values are ignored.    The same process is used to calculate the median IBU by state.
```{r medians_abv_1}
library(data.table)
# Calculate the median ABV values for each state, ignoring NAs.
abv_state_median <- aggregate(merged_beers_clean$ABV, 
                              list(merged_beers_clean$State), 
                              median, 
                              na.rm=TRUE)
names(abv_state_median)<-c("State", "Median_ABV")
sorted_abv_state_median<-abv_state_median[order(-abv_state_median$Median_ABV),]
sorted_abv_state_median$pgroup<-0
# Plot bar chart of median ABVs.

maxrow<-nrow(sorted_abv_state_median)

for (row in 1:maxrow) { 
  if (row < 6)  sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-1 
     else if (row < 11) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-2 
            else if (row < 16) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-3
                else if (row < 21) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-4
                      else if (row < 26) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-5
                          else if (row < 31) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-6
                              else if (row < 36) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-7
                                 else if (row < 41) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-8
                                       else if (row < 46) sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-9
                                           else  sorted_abv_state_median[row, "pgroup"]<-10
}

p1 <- ggplot(sorted_abv_state_median, aes(x=State, y=Median_ABV, fill=Median_ABV)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
 facet_wrap(~ pgroup, scales="free" ) +
#geom_text( aes( label = paste0( State ), y = sorted_abv_state_median$Median_ABV ), vjust = 1.4, size = 3, color = "white" ) +
coord_flip() + ggtitle("ABV Median by State") + xlab("State") + ylab("ABV Median") +
theme(panel.grid.minor =   element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major =  element_blank() )  # element_line(colour = "white",size=0.75))

p1

```


The output is a dataframe called abv_state_median that contains the median ABV value for each state.  The data is sorted and plotted using ggplot. 



```{r medians_ibu_1}

# Calculate the median IBU values for each state, ignoring NAs.

```


The output is a new dataframe called ibu_state_median that contains the median IBU value for each state.  The data is sorted and plotted using ggplot  


 


South Dakota's single brewery did not provide IBU values for its seven beers. For this reason, South Dakota has no bar in the bar graph above and its median IBU is reported as NA.

## 5. Which state has the most alcoholic beer by ABV? Most bitter beer by IBU? 

```{r maximums_state}

#The most alchoholic beer by ABV
abv_sorted_beers <- merged_beers_clean %>%  arrange(desc(ABV)) %>%  select(State, ABV)
head(abv_sorted_beers,1)

#The most bitter beer by IBU
ibu_sorted_beers <- merged_beers_clean %>%  arrange(desc(IBU)) %>%  select(State, IBU)
head(ibu_sorted_beers,1)

```

```{r reference_code, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
#Convert State from Factor to Character
merged_beers_clean$State <- as.character(merged_beers_clean$State)

#Determine the highest ABV in each State (return by State)
abv.agg <- aggregate(ABV ~ State, merged_beers_clean, max)

#Now Sort the states by ABV descending
sorted_abv_agg<-abv.agg %>% arrange(desc(ABV))
first_ten_abv<-head(sorted_abv_agg, 10)


#Determine the highest IBU in each State (return by State)
ibu.agg <- aggregate(IBU ~ State, merged_beers_clean, max)

#Now Sort the states by IBU descending
sorted_ibu_agg<-ibu.agg %>% arrange(desc(IBU))

```

Colorado has the most alcoholic beer by ABV, with 0.128. Oregon has the most bitter beer by IBU, with a value of 138.

## 6. Summary statistics.

The summary statistics for the ABV value show the Min, Max, Median, Mean, 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile.  

```{r abv-summary-stats}

# summary() shows five-number summary, mean, and NAs.
summary(merged_beers_clean$ABV)
summary(merged_beers_clean$IBU)

# Five-number summary can also be displayed in a boxplot.
ggplot(merged_beers_clean, aes(x="", y=ABV)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Placeholder ABV boxplot")
ggplot(merged_beers_clean, aes(x="", y=IBU)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Placeholder IBU boxplot")

```

Using simply the summary statistics gives some insight into the data.  Taking the summary statistics and looking at from a box plot perspective shows quite a few outliers on the high end and show some right skewedness.  50% of the ABV values are between .05 and .067 with a mean value of .05977 

## 7. Is there a relationship between ABV and IBU? 

With these two quantifiable variables for each beer, it is natural to wonder whether a relationship exists between them. A scatter plot is a useful visualization for this purpose.

```{r abv_ibu_relationship}

# Draw scatter plot using ggplot2.
abv_ibu_scatter <- merged_beers_clean %>% 
  filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>% filter(!is.na(IBU)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ABV, y = IBU)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE, alpha = 0.5, col="#F19800") +
  xlab("Alcohol By Volume (ABV)") +
  ylab("International Bitterness Units (IBU)") +
  ggtitle("Relationship Between Beer’s\nBitterness and Alcoholic Content") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
       axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
# Include linear regression with 95% pointwise confidence interval.
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = TRUE, 
              level = 0.95,
              aes(color = "CC720C", fill = "#F28E1C"))
 
abv_ibu_scatter

```

Based on the above scatter plot, there appears to be a positive correlation between ABV and IBU in this data. Generally speaking, as alcohol by volume increases, the bitterness in International Bitterness Units also tends to increase. The red best-fit line rising to the right upward diagonal represents this relationship. Note that any beer with at least one of its ABV or IBU values missing is not plotted.

``` {r correlation, message=F}

# Use cor() from base stats to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient.
r <- cor(merged_beers_clean$ABV, merged_beers_clean$IBU, 
         use = "pairwise.complete.obs",
         method = "pearson")

# Square Pearson's r to obtain coefficient of determination.
R_2 <- r^2

# Display r and R_2.
r_df <- data.frame("Variable" = c("Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)", 
                                  "Coefficient of Determination (R^2)"),
                   "Value" = c(r, R_2))
kable(r_df,
      row.names=F,
      caption="Quantified Correlation") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

Pearson's r quantifies the relationship between two variables on a scale of 0 (no linear association) to 1 (perfectly linear association). With r = 0.67, ABV and IBU in this data set have a moderate linear association.

# Additional Analysis

The above questions are a useful launching point to answer the client's problem: which state should The Meta Scientist be located in? Because beer diversity is such a high selling point for CCAC's brand, we investigate further into the choices available on a per state basis.

<!-- ## Style Analysis -->

```

## Beer & Style Analysis

One of the questions the client asked was how many breweries from each state are interested in submitting beers. A logical step from there is how many beers and how many styles of those beers are being made available by those breweries.

```{r per_state}

# Similarly to counting the number of breweries in each state, count the number of beers made in each state.
beers_count_state <- count(merged_beers_clean, "State")
names(beers_count_state)[names(beers_count_state) == "freq"] <- c("Num_Beers")

# Count the number of styles per state.
styles_count_state <- aggregate(Style ~ State, 
                               merged_beers_clean, 
                               function(x) length(unique(x)))
names(styles_count_state)[names(styles_count_state) == "Style"] <- c("Unique_Styles")

# Output the lists for breweries, beers, and styles for a side-by-side comparison.

      row.names = T,
      col.names = c("State", "Number of Breweries", 
                    "State", "Number of Beers",
                    "State", "Number of Styles"),

```

Although the number of unique beers and unique beer styles correlates with the number of breweries per state, the top ten states in these categories are not necessarily the same or in the same order, as shown by this table. For example, Illinois, ranked 12th for number of breweries, ranks 8th for number of beers, trading places with Washington state, ranked 8th for number of breweries and 12th for number of beers. New York, ranked 13th for breweries and 11th for number of beers, ranks 7th for unique styles.

The distinction between breweries and beers is worth considering because the numbers of available beers and styles, CCAC's main draw, can be directly quantified instead of looking at just the breweries alone. Current breweries may offer additional beers of different styles in the future, or new breweries may establish themselves in certain states, but neither of these are guaranteed.

CCAC also requested information on the states with the most alcoholic and most bitter beers available, indicating that beers high in ABV and/or IBU content are likely popular among current consumers. With one exception, the following states are notable for producing a beer within the top ten (or tied for a spot, indicated in the tables below by "=") for both:

State | Max ABV | ABV Rank | Max IBU | IBU Rank
:-----|---------|----------|---------|---------
CA | 0.099 | 5 | 115 | 8 (=)
CO | 0.128 | 1 | 104 | 15
IN | 0.120 | 3 | 115 | 8 (=)
MA | 0.099 | 7 (=) | 130 | 3
MN | 0.099 | 7 (=) | 120 | 5
TX | 0.099 | 7 (=) | 118 | 7
Median | 0.090 | NA | 90 | NA

Table: Top Candidates' Maximum ABV and IBU Values and Ranks

Of the states that are in both top ten lists for ABV and IBU, California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas also appear in the top ten for the number of breweries, beers, and styles per state. These four states are natural candidates for The Meta Scientist's location.

Although Colorado lands outside the top ten for maximum IBU, it places first in the other four rankings, as shown below. Considering that CCAC highly values beer variety, the fact that Colorado's breweries offer 45% more beers (265 beers compared to California's 183) and 28% more styles (60 styles compared to Indiana's 47) than the second-highest state in each category, along with the most alcoholic beer (Boulder-based Upslope Brewing Company's 19.2 oz Belgian Style Quadrupel [*sic*] Ale, with an ABU of 0.128), Colorado should also remain in consideration. 

State | ABV Rank | IBU Rank | Breweries Rank | Beer Rank | Style Rank
:-----|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------
CA | 5 | 8 (=) | 2 | 2 | 3
CO | 1 | 15 | 1 | 1 | 1
IN | 3 | 8 (=) | 9 | 4 | 2
MA | 7 (=) | 3 | 7 | 10 | 9
TX | 7 (=) | 7 | 5 | 5 | 5

Table: Top Candidate General Rankings

These five states: California, Colorado, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Texas, are our primary candidates for the new home of The Meta Scientist.

## ABV and IBU Minima

Another question the client asked was which states had the most alcoholic and most bitter beers. To consider the full spectrum, we investigate the opposite question: which states have the least alcoholic and least bitter beers?

```{r minimums_state}

# Lowest ABV and IBU per state.
abv_min_state <- aggregate(ABV ~ State, merged_beers_clean, min)
ibu_min_state <- aggregate(IBU ~ State, merged_beers_clean, min)
abv_min_median <- median(abv_min_state$ABV)
ibu_min_median <- median(ibu_min_state$IBU)
ibu_min_state <- rbind(ibu_min_state, c("SD", NA))
ibu_min_state$IBU <- as.numeric(ibu_min_state$IBU)

# Output for minimums of ABV and IBU in side-by-side comparison.
abv_min_state <- abv_min_state %>% arrange(ABV)
ibu_min_state <- ibu_min_state %>% arrange(IBU)
minimums_state <- data.frame(abv_min_state, ibu_min_state)
kable(minimums_state,
      row.names = T,
      col.names = c("State", "Minimum ABV", 
                    "State", "Minimum IBU"),
      caption = "Minimum ABVs and IBUs per state:",
      table.attr = "style='width:90%;'") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

State | Min ABV | ABV Rank | Min IBU | IBU Rank
:-----|---------|----------|---------|---------
CA | 0.001 | 1 | 4 | 1
CO | 0.041 | 30 | 9 | 17
IN | 0.040 | 18 (=) | 8 | 12 (=)
MA | 0.035 | 8 (=) | 7 | 8 (=)
TX | 0.040 | 18 (=) | 5 | 2 (=)
Median | 0.040 | NA | 10 | NA

Table: Top Candidates' Minimum ABV and IBU Values and Ranks

Of the candidates obtained from looking at the highest ABV/IBU and breweries/beers/styles lists, only California and Massachusetts also fall within the top ten for the lowest ABV and IBU. California ranks number one for both of these; its Scotty K NA has the lowest ABV at 0.001 (assuming this value is reported correctly, as the next lowest value is 0.027) and its Summer Solstice series has the lowest IBU at 4.

Beers without strong alcohol or bitterness may appeal to certain segments. In fact, one CCAC survey shows that some customers prefer beers high in alcoholic content but low in bitter flavor. As shown by the earlier correlation study, ABV and IBU typically trend together, so beers of this nature are rather uncommon (North Carolina's Devils Tramping Ground Tripel in the ABV/IBU scatter plot's lower right corner, with ABV = 0.092 and IBU = 5, is a standout exception). However, those same customers indicated bitterness is not a dealbreaker if the hops bring out other flavors.

Ultimately, beers with low ABV and IBU may be nice for targeting a specific audience, but CCAC currently prioritizes high ABV and IBU values.

## State ABV/IBU Summaries

We have analyzed the highest and lowest ABV and IBU values for the states, as well as given ABV summary statistics in an earlier question. To narrow the choices further, we consider both the ABV and IBU summary statistics for each of the states under consideration.

```{r abv_summary_1, message=F}

# Subset to 5 states: CA, CO, IN, MA, TX.
merged_beers_candidates <- subset(merged_beers_clean, State %in% c("CA", "CO", "IN", "MA", "TX"))
merged_beers_candidates$State <- factor(merged_beers_candidates$State)

# Boxplot for ABV distributions of candidates.
abv_summary_box <- merged_beers_candidates %>% 
  filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = ABV, fill = State)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "point",
               shape = 23,
               size = 1) +
  ggtitle("ABV Distributions Per State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Alcohol By Volume (ABV)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
abv_summary_box

```

```{r abv_summary_2, message=F, echo=F, results="hide"}

merged_beers_candidates %>% group_by(State) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Min = min(ABV),
                   Median = median(ABV),
                   Mean = mean(ABV),
                   IQRange = IQR(ABV),
                   Max = max(ABV))

```

State | Minimum | Median | Mean | IQRange | Maximum
:-----|---------|--------|------|---------|---------
National | 0.0010 | 0.0560 | 0.0598 | 0.0170 | 0.128
California | 0.0010 | 0.0580 | 0.0610 | 0.0200 | 0.099
Colorado | 0.0410 | 0.0605 | 0.0634 | 0.0189 | 0.128
Indiana | 0.040 | 0.0580 | 0.0634 | 0.0180 | 0.120
Massachusetts | 0.035 | 0.0540 | 0.0557 | 0.011 | 0.099
Texas | 0.040 | 0.0550 | 0.0598 | 0.0165 | 0.099

Table: ABV Summary Statistics for Candidates

As shown in the side-by-side boxplots, California, Colorado, Indiana, and Texas have relatively similar ABV distributions, aside from some outliers in both directions. Compared to the national ABV averages, using both median and mean as measures of center, California, Colorado, and Indiana produce slightly more alcoholic beers than average.

```{r ibu_summary_1}

# Boxplot for IBU distributions of canddiates.
ibu_summary_box <- merged_beers_candidates %>%
  filter(!is.na(IBU)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = IBU, fill = State)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "point",
               shape = 23,
               size = 1) +
  ggtitle("IBU Distributions Per State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("International Bitterness Units (IBU)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
ibu_summary_box

```

```{r ibu_summary_2, message=F, echo=F, results="hide"}

merged_beers_candidates %>% group_by(State) %>%
  filter(!is.na(IBU)) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Min = min(IBU),
                   Median = median(IBU),
                   Mean = mean(IBU),
                   IQRange = IQR(IBU),
                   Max = max(IBU))

```

State | Minimum | Median | Mean | IQRange | Maximum
:-----|---------|--------|------|---------|---------
National | 4 | 35 | 42.71 | 43 | 138
California | 4 | 42 | 46.28 | 49 | 115
Colorado | 9 | 40 | 47.43 | 42.25 | 104
Indiana | 8 | 33 | 42.99 | 37 | 115
Massachusetts | 7 | 35 | 38 | 25 | 130
Texas | 5 | 33 | 40.39 | 29 | 118

Table: IBU Summary Statistics for Candidates

Compared to the national IBU averages, using both median and mean as measures of center, California and Colorado produce beers more bitter than average. This is not unexpected, because more alcoholic beers tend to also be more bitter. 

# Conclusion

In summary, the following statements apply for the original Breweries.csv and Beers.csv data sets:

* Some beers lack values for ABV, IBU, and/or Style.
* ABV and IBU have a moderate positive correlation. As one increases, the other also tends to increase.
* By state, ABV has a median range of [0.040, 0.0625]. IBU has a median range of [19, 61].
* The state with the highest ABV is Colorado. The highest IBU belongs to Oregon. The lowest of both comes from California.

## Recommendation

Cheun Chugs & Cheers has several good choices in state for its new bar, The Meta Scientist. The company should carefully weigh the pros and cons of each state, along with any outside factors not accounted for in the provided data sets, before making its decision.

* Colorado, the state with the most breweries (47), also has the highest number of unique beers (265), the most unique styles (60), and the most alcoholic beer. It is the optimal choice for maximizing beer variety, providing the most alcoholic beer offered by a partner in the US, and providing more alcoholic beer in general.
* California, the state with the second most breweries (39), also has the second highest number of unique beers (183), the third highest number of unique styles (46), and the least alcoholic and least bitter beers. Because it has in-state offerings at both the low and high ends of the spectrum for ABV and IBU values, California boasts both beer variety and alcohol and bitterness range.
* Indiana and Texas are good fallback options in the Midwest and South. 
* Massachusetts is another option to extend the East Coast brand, offering a wide variety of notably less alcoholic and less bitter beers.
